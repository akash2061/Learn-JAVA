# Learn-JAVA

This repository documents my learning journey of the JAVA language.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders, where:

- `src`: The folder to maintain source code.
- `lib`: The folder to maintain dependencies.
- `bin`: The folder where compiled output files will be generated by default.

## Directory Tree

```ruby
